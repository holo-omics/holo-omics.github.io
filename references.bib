  abstract = "Due to the increasing throughput of current DNA sequencing
              instruments, sample multiplexing is necessary for making
              economical use of available sequencing capacities. A widely used
              multiplexing strategy for the Illumina Genome Analyzer utilizes
              sample-specific indexes, which are embedded in one of the library
              adapters. However, this and similar multiplex approaches come
              with a risk of sample misidentification. By introducing indexes
              into both library adapters (double indexing), we have developed a
              method that reveals the rate of sample misidentification within
              current multiplex sequencing experiments. With ~0.3\% these rates
              are orders of magnitude higher than expected and may severely
              confound applications in cancer genomics and other fields
              requiring accurate detection of rare variants. We identified the
              occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow as the predominant
              source of error. The accuracy of sample identification is further
              impaired if indexed oligonucleotides are cross-contaminated or if
              indexed libraries are amplified in bulk. Double-indexing
              eliminates these problems and increases both the scope and
              accuracy of multiplex sequencing on the Illumina platform.",

               communities are acquired horizontally after birth. This process
               is believed to be shaped by a combination of environmental and
               host genetic factors. We examined whether genetic variation in
               animal behavior could affect the composition of the animal's
               microbiota in different environments. The freshwater crustacean
               Daphnia magna is primarily planktonic but exhibits variation in
               the degree to which it browses in benthic sediments. We
               performed an experiment with clonal lines of D. magna showing
               different levels of sediment-browsing intensity exposed to
               either bacteria-rich or bacteria-poor sediment or whose access
               to sediments was prevented. We found that the bacterial
               composition of the environment and genotype-specific browsing
               intensity together influence the composition of the
               Daphnia-associated bacterial community. Exposure to more diverse
               bacteria did not lead to a more diverse microbiome, but greater
               abundances of environment-specific bacteria were found
               associated with host genotypes that exhibited greater browsing
               behavior. Our results indicate that, although there is a great
               deal of variation between individuals, behavior can mediate
               genotype-by-environment interaction effects on microbiome
               composition.IMPORTANCE An animal's behavior can affect its risk
               of infection, but it is not well understood how behavior affects
               microbiome composition. The aquatic crustacean Daphnia exhibits
               genetic variation in the extent to which it browses in the
               sediment at the bottoms of ponds. We show that this behavior
               affects the Daphnia microbiome, indicating that genetic
               variation among individuals may affect microbiome composition

               during the DNA extraction process may result in inaccurate
               microbial representation. In this study, we attempted to find a
               DNA extraction protocol which could be effectively used to
               analyze both the bacterial and fungal community. We evaluated
               the effect of five DNA extraction methods (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini
               Kit, PureLinkTM Microbiome DNA Purification Kit, ZR Fecal DNA
               MiniPrepTM Kit, NucleoSpin\textregistered{} DNA Stool Kit, and
               IHMS protocol Q) on bacterial and fungal gut microbiome recovery
               using (i) a defined system of germ-free mice feces spiked with
               bacterial or fungal strains, and (ii) non-spiked human feces. In
               our experimental setup, we confirmed that the examined methods
               significantly differed in efficiency and quality, which affected
               the identified stool microbiome composition. In addition, our
               results indicated that fungal DNA extraction might be prone to
               be affected by reagent/kit contamination, and thus an
               appropriate blank control should be included in mycobiome
               research. Overall, standardized IHMS protocol Q, recommended by
               the International Human Microbiome Consortium, performed the
               best when considering all the parameters analyzed, and thus
               could be applied not only in bacterial, but also in fungal

  abstract  = "A major challenge for RNA-seq analysis of gene expression is to
               achieve sufficient coverage of informative nonribosomal
               transcripts. In eukaryotic samples, this is typically achieved
               by selective oligo(dT)-priming of messenger RNAs to exclude
               ribosomal RNA (rRNA) during cDNA synthesis. However, this
               strategy is not compatible with prokaryotes in which functional
               transcripts are generally not polyadenylated. To overcome this,
               we adopted DASH (depletion of abundant sequences by
               hybridization), initially developed for eukaryotic cells, to
               improve both the sensitivity and depth of bacterial RNA-seq.
               DASH uses the Cas9 nuclease to remove unwanted cDNA sequences
               prior to library amplification. We report the design,
               evaluation, and optimization of DASH experiments for standard
               bacterial short-read sequencing approaches, including software
               for automated guide RNA (gRNA) design for Cas9-mediated cleavage

               sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial
               populations that may have important roles in their environments.
               Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates
               metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and
               pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and
               sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists
               to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction
               algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools
               for their evaluation and visualization. To address these
               challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for
               shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys
               state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing
               starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic
               bins and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give
               investigators control over the analysis, while still being
               easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms
               that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract
               and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin
               consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAP's hybrid bin extraction
               algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other
               bin consolidation programs in both synthetic and real data sets.
               Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis
               of metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance
               estimation, functional annotation, and visualization. MetaWRAP
               is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that automates the core tasks
               in metagenomic analysis, while contributing significant
               improvements to the extraction and interpretation of
               high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin refinement and reassembly
               modules of metaWRAP consistently outperform other binning
               approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is also a standalone
               component, making it a flexible and versatile tool for tackling

               importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of
               gene expression at the moment of RNA extraction. Until recently,
               there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity
               of RNA samples and the ratio of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA, the
               common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be
               inconsistent. The advent of microcapillary electrophoretic RNA
               separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput
               approach, in order to estimate the integrity of RNA samples in
               an unambiguous way. METHODS: A method is introduced that
               automatically selects features from signal measurements and
               constructs regression models based on a Bayesian learning
               technique. Feature spaces of different dimensionality are
               compared in the Bayesian framework, which allows selecting a
               final feature combination corresponding to models with high
               posterior probability. RESULTS: This approach is applied to a
               large collection of electrophoretic RNA measurements recorded
               with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that
               describes RNA integrity. The resulting algorithm is a
               user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for
               standardization of RNA quality control that allows the
               calculation of an RNA integrity number (RIN). CONCLUSION: Our
               results show the importance of taking characteristics of several
               regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order
               to get a robust and reliable prediction of RNA integrity,

               RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses at reasonable sequencing
               depth, typically, mature polyadenylated transcripts are enriched
               or rRNA molecules are depleted. Targeted depletion of rRNA is
               particularly useful when studying transcripts lacking a poly(A)
               tail, such as some non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), most bacterial RNAs
               and partially degraded or immature transcripts. While several
               commercially available kits allow effective rRNA depletion,
               their efficiency relies on a high degree of sequence homology
               between oligonucleotide probes and the target RNA. This
               restricts the use of such kits to a limited number of organisms

               dynamics of cell types of different species. In particular, for
               most non-model organisms lacking complete reference genomes with
               high-quality annotation of genetic information, reference-free
               (RF) de novo transcriptome analyses, rather than reference-based
               (RB) approaches, are widely used, and RF analyses have
               substantially contributed toward understanding the mechanisms
               regulating key biological processes and functions. To date,
               numerous bioinformatics studies have been conducted for
               assessing the workflow, production rate, and completeness of
               transcriptome assemblies within and between RF and RB datasets.
               However, the degree of consistency and variability of results
               obtained by analyzing gene expression levels through these two
               different approaches have not been adequately documented.
               RESULTS: In the present study, we evaluated the differences in
               expression profiles obtained with RF and RB approaches and
               revealed that the former tends to be satisfactorily replaced by
               the latter with respect to transcriptome repertoires, as well as
               from a gene expression quantification perspective. In addition,

               to large gene families must be validated carefully, whenever

              Ruminococcus were identified. Interestingly, v3-v4 amplicon data
              classified about 50\% of Ruminococcus reads as Ruminococcus
              gnavus species which showed maximum abundance in a 9 min beaten
              sample. However, the remaining 50\% of reads could not be
              assigned to any species. Full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing

              Ruminococcus albus species which unlike R. gnavus showed maximum
              recovery in the unbeaten sample instead. Furthermore, we found

              were differently sensitive to bead-beating treatment than the
              rest of the species in these genera. Thus, the present study

              bead-beating treatment that could only be resolved with full
              length 16S rRNA sequencing. This study identifies species of
