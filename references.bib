              reservoir for a wide range of epizootic and zoonotic diseases.
              Unfortunately, large-scale studies of bats and their guano
              microbiotas are limited by the time and cost of sample
              collection, which requires specially trained individuals to work
              at night to capture bats when they are most active. Indirectly
              surveying bat gut microbiota through guano deposits could be a
              more cost-effective alternative, but it must first be established
              whether the postdefecation exposure to an aerobic environment has
              a large impact on the guano microbial community. A number of
              recent studies on mammalian feces have shown that the impact of
              aerobic exposure is highly species specific; therefore, it is
              difficult to predict how exposure will affect the bat guano
              microbiota without empirical data. In our study, we collected
              fresh guano samples from 24 individuals of 10 bat species that
              are common throughout the arid environments of the American
              southwest and subjected the samples to 0, 1, and 12 hr of
              exposure. The biodiversity decreased rapidly after the shift from
              an anaerobic to an aerobic environment-much faster than
              previously reported in mammalian species. However, the relative
              composition of the core guano microbiota remained stable and,
              using highly sensitive targeted PCR methods, we found that
              pathogens present in the original, non-exposed samples could
              still be recovered after 12 hr of exposure. These results suggest
              that with careful sample analysis protocols, a more efficient
              passive collection strategy is feasible; for example, guano could
              be collected on tarps placed near the roost entrance. Such
              passive collection methods would greatly reduce the cost of
              sample collection by allowing more sites or roosts to be surveyed

               associated with respiratory illnesses, such as asthma.
               Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used to characterize
               the nasopharyngeal microbiome during health and disease. Most
               studies so far have surveyed the nasopharynx as a whole;
               however, less is known about spatial variation (biogeography) in
               nasal microenvironments and how sampling techniques may capture
               that microbial diversity. FINDINGS: We used targeted 16S rRNA
               MiSeq sequencing and two different sampling strategies [nasal
               washes (NW) and nasal brushes (NB)] to characterize the
               nasopharyngeal microbiota in 30 asthmatic children. Nasal
               brushing is more abrasive than nasal washing and targeted the
               inner portion of the inferior turbinate. This region is expected
               to be different from other nasal microenvironments. Nasal
               washing is not spatially specific. Our 30 $\times$ 2 nasal
               microbiomes generated 1,474,497 sequences, from which we
               identified an average of 157 and 186 OTUs per sample in the NW
               and NB groups, respectively. Microbiotas from NB showed
               significantly higher alpha-diversity than microbiotas from NW.
               Similarly, both nasal microbiotas were distinct from each other
               (PCoA) and significantly differed in their community composition
               and abundance in at least 9 genera (effective size $\geq$1 \%).
               CONCLUSIONS: Nasopharyngeal microenvironments in asthmatic
               children contain microbiotas with different diversity and
               structure. Nasal washes and brushes capture that diversity
               differently. Future microbial studies of the nasopharynx need to

               (UPLC-HRMS)-based polar metabolomics and lipidomics
               methodologies for faecal metabolomics. Both targeted (n > 400)
               and untargeted approaches were implemented to assess storage
               effects on individual chemical classes of metabolites as well as
               the faecal fingerprint. In general, recommendations are that
               intact stool samples should be divided into aliquots,
               lyophilised and stored at -80 °C for a period no longer than 18
               weeks, and avoiding any freeze-thawing. The first preservation
               week exerted the most decisive impact regarding storage
               temperature, i.e. 12.1\% and 6.4\% of the polar metabolome
               experienced a shift at -20 °C and at -80 °C, respectively,
               whereas 8.6\% and 7.9\% was observed to be changed significantly
               for the lipidome. In addition, aside from the negligible impact
               of aerobicity, the polar metabolome appeared to be more
               dependent on the storage conditions applied compared to the
               lipidome, which emerged as the more stable fraction when
               assessing the storage duration for 25 weeks. If the interest
               would greatly align with particular chemical classes, such as
               branched-chain amino acids or short-chain fatty acids, specific
               storage duration recommendations are reported. The provided
               insights on the stability of the faecal metabolome may
               contribute to a more reasoned design of experiments in biomarker
               detection or pathway elucidation within the field of faecal

              the potential to reveal interactions between host and microbiota
              in relation to disease risks. However, there are few studies
              evaluating how field methods influence fecal microbiome
              characterization and metabolomics profiling. Methods: Five fecal
              collection methods [immediate freezing at -20°C without
              preservative, OMNIgene GUT, 95\% ethanol, RNAlater, and Flinders
              Technology Associates (FTA) cards] were used to collect 40 fecal
              samples from eight healthy volunteers. We performed gut
              microbiota 16S rRNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics
              profiling, and targeted metabolomics focusing on short chained
              fatty acids (SCFAs). Metrics included $\alpha$-diversity and
              $\beta$-diversity as well as distributions of predominant phyla.
              To evaluate the concordance with the ``gold standard'' immediate
              freezing, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for
              alternate fecal collection systems were calculated. Correlations
              between SCFAs and gut microbiota were also examined. Results: The
              FTA cards had the highest ICCs compared to the immediate freezing
              method for $\alpha$-diversity indices (ICCs = 0.96, 0.96, 0.76
              for Shannon index, Simpson's Index, Chao-1 Index, respectively),
              followed by OMNIgene GUT, RNAlater, and 95\% ethanol. High ICCs
              (all >0.88) were observed for all methods for the
              $\beta$-diversity metric. For untargeted metabolomics, in
              comparison to immediate freezing which detected 621 metabolites
              at $\geq$75\% detectability level, 95\% ethanol showed the
              largest overlapping set of metabolites (n = 430; 69.2\%),
              followed by FTA cards (n = 330; 53.1\%) and OMNIgene GUT (n =
              213; 34.3\%). Both OMNIgene GUT (ICCs = 0.82, 0.93, 0.64) and FTA
              cards (ICCs = 0.87, 0.85, 0.54) had acceptable ICCs for the top
              three predominant SCFAs (butyric acid, propionic acid and acetic
              acid). Nominally significant correlations between bacterial
              genera and SCFAs (P < 0.05) were observed in fecal samples
              collected by different methods. Of note, a high correlation
              between the genus Blautia (known butyrate producer) and butyric
              acid was observed for both immediate freezing (r = 0.83) and FTA
              cards (r = 0.74). Conclusions: Four alternative fecal collection
              methods are generally comparable with immediate freezing, but
              there are differences in certain measures of the gut microbiome
              and fecal metabolome across methods. Choice of method depends on
              the research interests, simplicity of fecal collection procedures

               serum is a biomarker of growing interest, especially in prenatal
               diagnosis and oncology. The objectives of the present study were
               to compare the DNase activity in these specimens and to
               investigate its ex-vivo impact over the circulating cell-free
               DNA yield (ccfDNA), using the circulating cell-free fetal DNA
               (ccffDNA) as a tool. DESIGN AND METHODS: EDTA-plasma and serum
               from women bearing male fetus were submitted to an endogenous
               DNase activity assay based on qPCR hydrolysis probe degradation,
               they were treated with DNAse I to investigate the action of an
               exogenous nuclease and also submitted to different temperature
               conditions to investigate the temperature-dependent degradation
               of the ccffDNA. In all instances, all male ccffDNA were
               quantified by qPCR targeting the Y chromosome-specific sequence
               DYS-14. Moreover, a serial dilution of EDTA was added to
               nonanticoagulated plasma and serum before the endogenous DNAse
               activity assay, to investigate the EDTA-mediated inhibition of
               the blood's DNase. RESULTS: The endogenous nuclease activity was
               14.9-fold higher in serum compared to EDTA-plasma. The DNAse I
               treatment did not alter the ccffDNA yields in EDTA-plasma, but
               completely degraded it in serum. The addition of increasing
               doses of EDTA to nonanticoagulated plasma and serum resulted in
               a stepwise inhibition of their nucleases activity. Finally, we
               observed a much more pronounced temperature-mediated decrease on
               the ccffDNA amount in serum compared to EDTA-plasma. CONCLUSION:
               The exogenous and endogenous DNases are more active in serum,
               the anticoagulant EDTA indirectly inhibits blood DNases, and
               consequently ccfDNA is protected from the blood's DNase

              simultaneously preserving the viral RNA. Here, we present a
              storage buffer containing guanidine-hydrochloride that fulfils
              both requirements. Its ability to preserve RNA stability was
              confirmed by RT-qPCR, and virus-inactivating properties were

              that RNA from samples diluted in this storage buffer was
              efficiently preserved. Spiking samples with RNase A resulted in
              RNAse concentrations up to 100 ng/mL being efficiently inhibited,

               often scarce, and/or irreplaceable. TRIzol\textregistered{} and
               TRIzol\textregistered{}LS are suitable for simultaneous
               isolation of RNA, DNA and proteins from the same biological
               sample. These reagents are widely used for RNA and/or DNA
               isolation, while reports on their use for protein extraction are
               limited, attributable to technical difficulties in protein
               solubilisation. Results TRIzol\textregistered{}LS was used for
               RNA isolation from 284 human colon cancer samples, including
               normal colon mucosa, tubulovillous adenomas, and colon
               carcinomas with proficient and deficient mismatch repair system.
               TRIzol\textregistered{} was used for RNA isolation from human
               colon cancer cells, from brains of transgenic Alzheimer's
               disease mice model, and from cultured mouse cortical neurons.
               Following RNA extraction, the TRIzol\textregistered{}-chloroform
               fractions from human colon cancer samples and from mouse
               hippocampus and frontal cortex were stored for 2 years and 3
               months, respectively, at −80°C until used for protein isolation.
               Simple modifications to the TRIzol\textregistered{}
               manufacturer's protocol, including Urea:SDS solubilization and
               sonication, allowed improved protein recovery yield compared to
               the TRIzol\textregistered{} manufacturer's protocol. Following
               SDS-PAGE and Ponceau and Coomassie staining, recovered proteins
               displayed wide molecular weight range and staining pattern
               comparable to those obtainable with commonly used protein
               extraction protocols. We also show that nuclear and cytosolic
               proteins can be easily extracted and detected by immunoblotting,
               and that posttranslational modifications, such as protein
               phosphorylation, are detectable in proteins recovered from
               TRIzol\textregistered{}-chloroform fractions stored for up to 2
               years at −80°C. Conclusions We provide a novel approach to
               improve protein recovery from samples processed for nucleic acid

               TRIzol\textregistered{}LS compared to the manufacturer`s
               protocol, allowing downstream immunoblotting and evaluation of
               steady-state relative protein expression levels. The method was
               validated in large sets of samples from multiple sources,

               unfolding does not take place in acetate under otherwise
               identical conditions. We demonstrate that heating of
               protein-containing bicarbonate solutions results in extensive
               foaming, caused by CO2 outgassing. In contrast, acetate
               solutions do not generate foam. Protein denaturation caused by
               gas bubbles is a well-known phenomenon. Adsorption to the
               gas/liquid interface is accompanied by major conformational
               changes that allow the protein to act as a surfactant. The
               foaming of beer is a manifestation of this effect. Bubble
               formation in bicarbonate during ESI is facilitated by
               collisional and blackbody droplet heating. Our data imply that
               heat and bubbles act synergistically to cause unfolding during
               the electrospray process, while proteins reside in ESI droplets.
               Because of this effect we advise against the use of ammonium
               bicarbonate for native ESI-MS. Ammonium acetate represents a
               gentler droplet environment, despite its low buffering capacity.",

              economical use of available sequencing capacities. A widely used
              multiplexing strategy for the Illumina Genome Analyzer utilizes
              sample-specific indexes, which are embedded in one of the library
              adapters. However, this and similar multiplex approaches come
              with a risk of sample misidentification. By introducing indexes
              into both library adapters (double indexing), we have developed a
              method that reveals the rate of sample misidentification within
              current multiplex sequencing experiments. With ~0.3\% these rates
              are orders of magnitude higher than expected and may severely
              confound applications in cancer genomics and other fields

              occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow as the predominant
              source of error. The accuracy of sample identification is further
              impaired if indexed oligonucleotides are cross-contaminated or if
              indexed libraries are amplified in bulk. Double-indexing

              of the high-risk patients by prognostic outcome is important for
              treatment. However, there is still a lack of survival
              stratification for the high-risk neuroblastoma. To fill the gap,
              we adopt a deep learning algorithm, Autoencoder, to integrate
              multi-omics data, and combine it with K-means clustering to
              identify two subtypes with significant survival differences. By
              comparing the Autoencoder with PCA, iCluster, and DGscore about
              the classification based on multi-omics data integration,
              Autoencoder-based classification outperforms the alternative
              approaches. Furthermore, we also validated the classification in
              two independent datasets by training machine-learning
              classification models, and confirmed its robustness. Functional
              analysis revealed that MYCN amplification was more frequently

               the fecal microbiota does not fully represent that of the
               gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the efficacy of fecal sampling
               to accurately represent the gut microbiota in birds is poorly
               understood. In this study, we aim to identify the efficacy of
               feces as a gut proxy in birds using chickens as a model. We
               collected 1,026 samples from 206 chickens, including duodenum,
               jejunum, ileum, cecum, and feces samples, for 16S rRNA amplicon
               sequencing analyses. In this study, the efficacy of feces as a
               gut proxy was partitioned to microbial community membership and
               community structure. Most taxa in the small intestine
               (84.11--87.28\%) and ceca (99.39\%) could be identified in
               feces. Microbial community membership was reflected with a gut
               anatomic feature, but community structure was not. Excluding
               shared microbes, the small intestine and ceca contributed 34.12
               and 5.83\% of the total fecal members, respectively. The
               composition of Firmicutes members in the small intestine and
               that of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and
               Proteobacteria members in the ceca could be well mirrored by the
               observations in fecal samples ($\rho$ = 0.54--0.71 and
               0.71--0.78, respectively, P < 0.001). However, there were few
               significant correlations for each genus between feces and each
               of the four gut segments, and these correlations were not high
               ($\rho$ = −0.2--0.4, P < 0.05) for most genera. Our results
               suggest that fecal microbial community has a good potential to
               identify most taxa in the chicken gut and could moderately
               mirror the microbial structure in the intestine at the microbial
               population level with phylum specificity. However, it should be
               interpreted with caution by using feces as a proxy to study

  abstract  = "ABSTRACT In many organisms, host-associated microbial
               communities are acquired horizontally after birth. This process
               is believed to be shaped by a combination of environmental and
               host genetic factors. We examined whether genetic variation in
               animal behavior could affect the composition of the animal's
               microbiota in different environments. The freshwater crustacean
               Daphnia magna is primarily planktonic but exhibits variation in
               the degree to which it browses in benthic sediments. We
               performed an experiment with clonal lines of D. magna showing
               different levels of sediment-browsing intensity exposed to
               either bacteria-rich or bacteria-poor sediment or whose access
               to sediments was prevented. We found that the bacterial
               composition of the environment and genotype-specific browsing
               intensity together influence the composition of the
               Daphnia-associated bacterial community. Exposure to more diverse
               bacteria did not lead to a more diverse microbiome, but greater
               abundances of environment-specific bacteria were found
               associated with host genotypes that exhibited greater browsing
               behavior. Our results indicate that, although there is a great
               deal of variation between individuals, behavior can mediate
               genotype-by-environment interaction effects on microbiome
               composition.IMPORTANCE An animal's behavior can affect its risk
               of infection, but it is not well understood how behavior affects
               microbiome composition. The aquatic crustacean Daphnia exhibits
               genetic variation in the extent to which it browses in the
               sediment at the bottoms of ponds. We show that this behavior
               affects the Daphnia microbiome, indicating that genetic
               variation among individuals may affect microbiome composition
               and the movement of bacteria in different environments.",

               achieve sufficient coverage of informative nonribosomal
               transcripts. In eukaryotic samples, this is typically achieved
               by selective oligo(dT)-priming of messenger RNAs to exclude
               ribosomal RNA (rRNA) during cDNA synthesis. However, this
               strategy is not compatible with prokaryotes in which functional
               transcripts are generally not polyadenylated. To overcome this,
               we adopted DASH (depletion of abundant sequences by
               hybridization), initially developed for eukaryotic cells, to
               improve both the sensitivity and depth of bacterial RNA-seq.
               DASH uses the Cas9 nuclease to remove unwanted cDNA sequences
               prior to library amplification. We report the design,

               and technologies are used to measure diverse but related
               information, and the task of clustering a set of objects based
               on multiple sources of data arises in several applications. Most
               current approaches to multisource clustering either
               independently determine a separate clustering for each data
               source or determine a single 'joint' clustering for all data
               sources. There is a need for more flexible approaches that
               simultaneously model the dependence and the heterogeneity of the
               data sources. RESULTS: We propose an integrative statistical
               model that permits a separate clustering of the objects for each
               data source. These separate clusterings adhere loosely to an
               overall consensus clustering, and hence they are not
               independent. We describe a computationally scalable Bayesian
               framework for simultaneous estimation of both the consensus
               clustering and the source-specific clusterings. We demonstrate
               that this flexible approach is more robust than joint clustering
               of all data sources, and is more powerful than clustering each

               sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial
               populations that may have important roles in their environments.
               Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates
               metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and
               pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and
               sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists
               to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction
               algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools
               for their evaluation and visualization. To address these
               challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for
               shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys
               state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing
               starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic
               bins and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give
               investigators control over the analysis, while still being
               easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms
               that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract
               and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin
               consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAP's hybrid bin extraction
               algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other
               bin consolidation programs in both synthetic and real data sets.
               Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis
               of metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance
               estimation, functional annotation, and visualization. MetaWRAP
               is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that automates the core tasks
               in metagenomic analysis, while contributing significant
               improvements to the extraction and interpretation of
               high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin refinement and reassembly
               modules of metaWRAP consistently outperform other binning
               approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is also a standalone
               component, making it a flexible and versatile tool for tackling
               metagenomic shotgun sequencing data. MetaWRAP is open-source

               technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and
               that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are

               derives mostly from studies in which elucidation of
               microbe-microbe interactions is difficult. In exploring how
               Drosophila melanogaster acquires its microbiome, we found that a
               microbial community influences Drosophila olfactory and
               egg-laying behaviors differently than individual members.
               Drosophila prefers a Saccharomyces-Acetobacter co-culture to the
               same microorganisms grown individually and then mixed, a
               response mainly due to the conserved olfactory receptor, Or42b.
               Acetobacter metabolism of Saccharomyces-derived ethanol was
               necessary, and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were
               sufficient, for co-culture preference. Preference correlated
               with three emergent co-culture properties: ethanol catabolism, a
               distinct volatile profile, and yeast population decline.
               Egg-laying preference provided a context-dependent fitness

               invading pathogens, while still maintaining self-tolerance to

               microbiota that resides in the gastrointestinal tract provides
               essential health benefits to its host, particularly by
               regulating immune homeostasis. Moreover, it has recently become

               importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of
               gene expression at the moment of RNA extraction. Until recently,
               there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity
               of RNA samples and the ratio of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA, the
               common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be
               inconsistent. The advent of microcapillary electrophoretic RNA
               separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput
               approach, in order to estimate the integrity of RNA samples in
               an unambiguous way. METHODS: A method is introduced that
               automatically selects features from signal measurements and
               constructs regression models based on a Bayesian learning
               technique. Feature spaces of different dimensionality are
               compared in the Bayesian framework, which allows selecting a
               final feature combination corresponding to models with high
               posterior probability. RESULTS: This approach is applied to a
               large collection of electrophoretic RNA measurements recorded
               with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that
               describes RNA integrity. The resulting algorithm is a
               user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for
               standardization of RNA quality control that allows the
               calculation of an RNA integrity number (RIN). CONCLUSION: Our
               results show the importance of taking characteristics of several
               regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order

               RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses at reasonable sequencing
               depth, typically, mature polyadenylated transcripts are enriched
               or rRNA molecules are depleted. Targeted depletion of rRNA is
               particularly useful when studying transcripts lacking a poly(A)
               tail, such as some non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), most bacterial RNAs

               their efficiency relies on a high degree of sequence homology

               most non-model organisms lacking complete reference genomes with
               high-quality annotation of genetic information, reference-free
               (RF) de novo transcriptome analyses, rather than reference-based
               (RB) approaches, are widely used, and RF analyses have
               substantially contributed toward understanding the mechanisms
               regulating key biological processes and functions. To date,
               numerous bioinformatics studies have been conducted for
               assessing the workflow, production rate, and completeness of
               transcriptome assemblies within and between RF and RB datasets.
               However, the degree of consistency and variability of results
               obtained by analyzing gene expression levels through these two
               different approaches have not been adequately documented.
               RESULTS: In the present study, we evaluated the differences in
               expression profiles obtained with RF and RB approaches and
               revealed that the former tends to be satisfactorily replaced by
               the latter with respect to transcriptome repertoires, as well as
               from a gene expression quantification perspective. In addition,
               we urge cautious interpretation of these findings. Several genes

               to large gene families must be validated carefully, whenever

               allowed researchers to examine the genetic etiology of complex
               human traits in a robust fashion. Although genome-wide
               association studies have identified many novel variants
               associated with hundreds of traits, a large proportion of the
               estimated trait heritability remains unexplained. One hypothesis
               is that the commonly used statistical techniques and study
               designs are not robust to the complex etiology that may underlie
               these human traits. This etiology could include non-linear gene
               $\times$ gene or gene $\times$ environment interactions.
               Additionally, other levels of biological regulation may play a
               large role in trait variability. RESULTS: To address the need
               for computational tools that can explore enormous datasets to
               detect complex susceptibility models, we have developed a
               software package called the Analysis Tool for Heritable and
               Environmental Network Associations (ATHENA). ATHENA combines
               various variable filtering methods with machine learning
               techniques to analyze high-throughput categorical (i.e. single
               nucleotide polymorphisms) and quantitative (i.e. gene expression
               levels) predictor variables to generate multivariable models

               quantitative (i.e. cholesterol levels) outcomes. The goal of
               this article is to demonstrate the utility of ATHENA using
               simulated and biological datasets that consist of both single
               nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression variables to
               identify complex prediction models. Importantly, this method is

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of sequencing
               technologies, collecting diverse types of cancer omics data
               become more cost-effective. Many computational methods attempted
               to represent and fuse multiple omics into a comprehensive view
               of cancer. However, different types of omics are related and
               heterogeneous. Most of the existing methods do not consider the
               difference between omics, so the biological knowledge of
               individual omics may not be fully excavated. And for a given
               task (e.g. predicting overall survival), these methods prefer to
               use sample similarity or domain knowledge to learn a more
               reasonable representation of omics, but it's not enough.
               METHODS: For the purpose of learning more useful representation
               for individual omics and fusing them to improve the prediction
               ability, we proposed an autoencoder-based method named MOSAE
               (Multi-omics Supervised Autoencoder). In our method, a specific
               autoencoder were designed for each omics according to their size
               of dimension to generate omics-specific representations. Then, a
               supervised autoencoder was constructed based on specific
               autoencoder by using labels to enforce each specific autoencoder
               to learn both omics-specific and task-specific representations.
               Finally, representations of different omics that generate from
               supervised autoencoders were fused in a traditional but powerful
               way, and the fused representation was used for subsequent
               predictive tasks. RESULTS: We applied our method over TCGA
               Pan-Cancer dataset to predict four different clinical outcome
               endpoints (OS, PFI, DFI, and DSS). Compared with traditional and
               state-of-the-art methods, MOSAE achieved better predictive
               performance. We also tested the effects of each improvement,
               which all have a positive effect on predictive performance.
               CONCLUSIONS: Predicting clinical outcome endpoints are very
               important for precision medicine and personalized medicine. And
               multi-omics fusion is an effective way to solve this problem.
               MOSAE is a powerful multi-omics fusion method, which can
               generate both omics-specific and task-specific representation

              complete microbial cell lysis and accurate assessment of the
              abundance and composition of the microbiome. While the impact of
              bead-beating on the recovery of OTUs at the phylum and class
              level have been studied, its influence on species-level
              microbiome recovery is not clear. Recent advances in sequencing
              technology has allowed species-level resolution of the microbiome
              using full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing instead of smaller
              amplicons that only capture a few hypervariable regions of the
              gene. We sequenced the v3-v4 hypervariable region as well as the
              full length 16S rRNA gene in mouse and human stool samples and
              discovered major clusters of gut bacteria that exhibit different
              levels of sensitivity to bead-beating treatment. Full length 16S
              rRNA gene sequencing unraveled vast species diversity in the
              mouse and human gut microbiome and enabled characterization of
              several unclassified OTUs in amplicon data. Many species of major
              gut commensals such as Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Blautia,
              Clostridium, Escherichia, Roseburia, Helicobacter, and
              Ruminococcus were identified. Interestingly, v3-v4 amplicon data
              classified about 50\% of Ruminococcus reads as Ruminococcus
              gnavus species which showed maximum abundance in a 9 min beaten
              sample. However, the remaining 50\% of reads could not be
              assigned to any species. Full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing
              data showed that the majority of the unclassified reads were
              Ruminococcus albus species which unlike R. gnavus showed maximum
              recovery in the unbeaten sample instead. Furthermore, we found
              that the Blautia hominis and Streptococcus parasanguinis species
              were differently sensitive to bead-beating treatment than the
              rest of the species in these genera. Thus, the present study
              demonstrates species level variations in sensitivity to
              bead-beating treatment that could only be resolved with full
              length 16S rRNA sequencing. This study identifies species of
              common gut commensals and potential pathogens that require
              minimum (0-1 min) or extensive (4-9 min) bead-beating for their

               are mainly based on individual data types. However, the analysis
               of multidimensional patient data involving the measurements of
               various molecular features could reveal intrinsic
               characteristics of the tumor. Large-scale projects accumulate
               this kind of data for various cancer types, but we still lack
               the computational methods to reliably integrate this information
               in a meaningful manner. Therefore, we apply and extend current
               multiple kernel learning for dimensionality reduction
               approaches. On the one hand, we add a regularization term to
               avoid overfitting during the optimization procedure, and on the

               comparable to the best of nine state-of-the-art multi-omics

               has highlighted a particular challenge: to integrate the
               different views of the genome that are provided by various types
               of experimental data. RESULTS: This paper describes a
               computational framework for integrating and drawing inferences
               from a collection of genome-wide measurements. Each dataset is
               represented via a kernel function, which defines generalized
               similarity relationships between pairs of entities, such as
               genes or proteins. The kernel representation is both flexible
               and efficient, and can be applied to many different types of
               data. Furthermore, kernel functions derived from different types
               of data can be combined in a straightforward fashion. Recent
               advances in the theory of kernel methods have provided efficient
               algorithms to perform such combinations in a way that minimizes
               a statistical loss function. These methods exploit semidefinite
               programming techniques to reduce the problem of finding
               optimizing kernel combinations to a convex optimization problem.

               The most effective prognostic prediction methods should use all
               available data, as this maximizes the amount of information
               used. In this article, we consider a variety of learning
               strategies to boost prediction performance based on the use of
               all available data. IMPLEMENTATION: We consider data integration
               via the use of multiple kernel learning supervised learning
               methods. We propose a scheme in which feature selection by
               statistical score is performed separately per data type and by
               pathway membership. We further consider the introduction of a
               confidence measure for the class assignment, both to remove some
               ambiguously labeled datapoints from the training data and to
               implement a cautious classifier that only makes predictions when
               the associated confidence is high. RESULTS: We use the METABRIC
               dataset for breast cancer, with prediction of survival at 2000
               days from diagnosis. Predictive accuracy is improved by using
               kernels that exclusively use those genes, as features, which are
               known members of particular pathways. We show that yet further
               improvements can be made by using a range of additional kernels
               based on clinical covariates such as Estrogen Receptor (ER)
               status. Using this range of measures to improve prediction

               the study of sequence variations in a genome. However, existing
               algorithms either collapse heterozygous alleles into one
               consensus copy or fail to cleanly separate the haplotypes to
               produce high-quality phased assemblies. Here we describe
               hifiasm, a de novo assembler that takes advantage of long
               high-fidelity sequence reads to faithfully represent the
               haplotype information in a phased assembly graph. Unlike other
               graph-based assemblers that only aim to maintain the contiguity
               of one haplotype, hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of
               all haplotypes. This feature enables the development of a graph
               trio binning algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio
               binning. On three human and five nonhuman datasets, including

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Cancer can involve gene dysregulation via multiple
               mechanisms, so no single level of genomic data fully elucidates
               tumor behavior due to the presence of numerous genomic
               variations within or between levels in a biological system. We
               have previously proposed a graph-based integration approach that
               combines multi-omics data including copy number alteration,
               methylation, miRNA, and gene expression data for predicting
               clinical outcome in cancer. However, genomic features likely
               interact with other genomic features in complex signaling or
               regulatory networks, since cancer is caused by alterations in
               pathways or complete processes. METHODS: Here we propose a new
               graph-based framework for integrating multi-omics data and
               genomic knowledge to improve power in predicting clinical
               outcomes and elucidate interplay between different levels. To
               highlight the validity of our proposed framework, we used an
               ovarian cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas for
               predicting stage, grade, and survival outcomes. RESULTS:
               Integrating multi-omics data with genomic knowledge to construct
               pre-defined features resulted in higher performance in clinical
               outcome prediction and higher stability. For the grade outcome,
               the model with gene expression data produced an area under the
               receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7866.
               However, models of the integration with pathway, Gene Ontology,
               chromosomal gene set, and motif gene set consistently
               outperformed the model with genomic data only, attaining AUCs of
               0.7873, 0.8433, 0.8254, and 0.8179, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
               Integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve
               understanding of molecular pathogenesis and underlying biology

               However, because many categories of gene function have a small
               number of annotations, the process of assigning these network

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Presently, with the increasing number and complexity
               of available gene expression datasets, the combination of data
               from multiple microarray studies addressing a similar biological
               question is gaining importance. The analysis and integration of
               multiple datasets are expected to yield more reliable and robust
               results since they are based on a larger number of samples and
               the effects of the individual study-specific biases are
               diminished. This is supported by recent studies suggesting that
               important biological signals are often preserved or enhanced by
               multiple experiments. An approach to combining data from
               different experiments is the aggregation of their clusterings
               into a consensus or representative clustering solution which
               increases the confidence in the common features of all the
               datasets and reveals the important differences among them.
               RESULTS: We propose a novel generic consensus clustering
               technique that applies Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) approach
               for the consolidation and analysis of clustering solutions
               derived from several microarray datasets. These datasets are
               initially divided into groups of related experiments with
               respect to a predefined criterion. Subsequently, a consensus
               clustering algorithm is applied to each group resulting in a
               clustering solution per group.These solutions are pooled
               together and further analysed by employing FCA which allows
               extracting valuable insights from the data and generating a gene
               partition over all the experiments. In order to validate the
               FCA-enhanced approach two consensus clustering algorithms are
               adapted to incorporate the FCA analysis. Their performance is
               evaluated on gene expression data from multi-experiment study
               examining the global cell-cycle control of fission yeast. The
               FCA results derived from both methods demonstrate that, although
               both algorithms optimize different clustering characteristics,
               FCA is able to overcome and diminish these differences and
               preserve some relevant biological signals. CONCLUSIONS: The
               proposed FCA-enhanced consensus clustering technique is a
               general approach to the combination of clustering algorithms
               with FCA for deriving clustering solutions from multiple gene
               expression matrices. The experimental results presented herein
               demonstrate that it is a robust data integration technique able
               to produce good quality clustering solution that is
               representative for the whole set of expression matrices.",

  abstract  = "A cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a metastatic cancer for
               which standard diagnostic tests fail to locate the primary
               cancer. As standard treatments are based on the cancer type,
               such cases are hard to treat and have very poor prognosis. Using
               molecular data from the metastatic cancer to predict the primary
               site can make treatment choice easier and enable targeted
               therapy. In this article, we first examine the ability to
               predict cancer type using different types of omics data.
               Methylation data lead to slightly better prediction than gene
               expression and both these are superior to classification using
               somatic mutations. After using 3 data types independently, we
               notice some differences between the classes that tend to be
               misclassified, suggesting that integrating the data might
               improve accuracy. In light of the different levels of
               information provided by different omics types and to be able to
               handle missing data, we perform multi-omics classification by
               hierarchically combining the classifiers. The proposed
               hierarchical method first classifies based on the most
               informative type of omics data and then uses the other types of
               omics data to classify samples that did not get a high

               predict the drug resistance of HIV protease mutants may be
               useful in developing more effective and longer lasting treatment
               regimens. METHODS: The HIV resistance is predicted to two
               current protease inhibitors, Indinavir and Saquinavir. The
               problem was approached from two perspectives. First, a predictor
               was constructed based on the structural features of the HIV
               protease-drug inhibitor complex. A particular structure was
               represented by its list of contacts between the inhibitor and
               the protease. Next, a classifier was constructed based on the
               sequence data of various drug resistant mutants. In both cases,
               self-organizing maps were first used to extract the important
               features and cluster the patterns in an unsupervised manner.
               This was followed by subsequent labelling based on the known
               patterns in the training set. RESULTS: The prediction
               performance of the classifiers was measured by cross-validation.
               The classifier using the structure information correctly
               classified previously unseen mutants with an accuracy of between
               60 and 70\%. Several architectures were tested on the more
               abundant sequence data. The best single classifier provided an

               This method projects multiple types of genomic data onto a

               and microRNA expression data of 385 ovarian cancer samples from
               the The Cancer Genome Atlas project. These md-modules revealed

               dimensionality of these components (spaces) inferred via a

               at the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels.
               Genomic profiling at these multiple levels should allow an
               integrated characterization of tumor etiology. However, there is
               a shortage of effective statistical and bioinformatic tools for
               truly integrative data analysis. The standard approach to
               integrative clustering is separate clustering followed by manual
               integration. A more statistically powerful approach would
               incorporate all data types simultaneously and generate a single
               integrated cluster assignment. METHODS: We developed a joint
               latent variable model for integrative clustering. We call the
               resulting methodology iCluster. iCluster incorporates flexible
               modeling of the associations between different data types and
               the variance-covariance structure within data types in a single
               framework, while simultaneously reducing the dimensionality of
               the datasets. Likelihood-based inference is obtained through the
               Expectation-Maximization algorithm. RESULTS: We demonstrate the
               iCluster algorithm using two examples of joint analysis of copy
               number and gene expression data, one from breast cancer and one
               from lung cancer. In both cases, we identified subtypes

               discover cancer subtypes and their molecular drivers in a
               comprehensive genetic context. Curtis et al. [Nature (2012)
               486(7403):346-352] has recently shown that integrative
               clustering of copy number and gene expression in 2,000 breast
               tumors reveals novel subgroups beyond the classic expression
               subtypes that show distinct clinical outcomes. To extend the
               scope of integrative analysis for the inclusion of somatic
               mutation data by massively parallel sequencing, we propose a
               framework for joint modeling of discrete and continuous
               variables that arise from integrated genomic, epigenomic, and

               a set of orthogonal latent variables that represent distinct
               molecular drivers, and thus can reveal tumor subgroups of
               biological and clinical importance. Using the cancer cell line

               algorithm, termed moCluster, which discovers joint patterns
               among multiple omics data. The method first employs a multiblock
               multivariate analysis to define a set of latent variables
               representing joint patterns across input data sets, which is
               further passed to an ordinary clustering algorithm in order to
               discover joint clusters. Using simulated data, we show that
               moCluster's performance is not compromised by issues present in
               iCluster/iCluster+ (notably, the nondeterministic solution) and
               that it operates 100$\times$ to 1000$\times$ faster than

               to identify molecular subtypes for more accurate cancer
               diagnoses and treatments. To deal with high-dimensional cancer
               multi-omics data, a promising strategy is to find an effective
               low-dimensional subspace of the original data and then cluster
               cancer samples in the reduced subspace. However, due to
               data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods can
               integrative and efficiently find the principal low-dimensional
               manifold of the high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data.
               RESULTS: In this study, we proposed a novel low-rank
               approximation based integrative probabilistic model to fast find
               the shared principal subspace across multiple data types: the
               convexity of the low-rank regularized likelihood function of the
               probabilistic model ensures efficient and stable model fitting.
               Candidate molecular subtypes can be identified by unsupervised
               clustering hundreds of cancer samples in the reduced
               low-dimensional subspace. On testing datasets, our method
               LRAcluster (low-rank approximation based multi-omics data
               clustering) runs much faster with better clustering performances
               than the existing method. Then, we applied LRAcluster on
               large-scale cancer multi-omics data from TCGA. The pan-cancer
               analysis results show that the cancers of different tissue
               origins are generally grouped as independent clusters, except
               squamous-like carcinomas. While the single cancer type analysis
               suggests that the omics data have different subtyping abilities

               signatures is an important task in cancer translational research
               for precision medicine. Large-scale genomic profiling studies
               such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have
               generated vast amounts of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic,
               and proteomic data. While these studies have provided great
               resources for researchers to discover clinically relevant tumor
               subtypes and driver molecular alterations, there are few
               computationally efficient methods and tools for integrative
               clustering analysis of these multi-type omics data. Therefore,
               the aim of this article is to develop a fully Bayesian latent
               variable method (called iClusterBayes) that can jointly model
               omics data of continuous and discrete data types for
               identification of tumor subtypes and relevant omics features.
               Specifically, the proposed method uses a few latent variables to
               capture the inherent structure of multiple omics data sets to
               achieve joint dimension reduction. As a result, the tumor
               samples can be clustered in the latent variable space and
               relevant omics features that drive the sample clustering are
               identified through Bayesian variable selection. This method
               significantly improve on the existing integrative clustering
               method iClusterPlus in terms of statistical inference and
               computational speed. By analyzing TCGA and simulated data sets,
               we demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method
               in revealing clinically meaningful tumor subtypes and driver
               omics features.",

               and Maliepaard, Chris",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In order to find genetic and metabolic pathways
               related to phenotypic traits of interest, we analyzed gene
               expression data, metabolite data obtained with GC-MS and LC-MS,
               proteomics data and a selected set of tuber quality phenotypic
               data from a diploid segregating mapping population of potato. In
               this study we present an approach to integrate these ~ omics
               data sets for the purpose of predicting phenotypic traits. This
               gives us networks of relatively small sets of interrelated ~
               omics variables that can predict, with higher accuracy, a
               quality trait of interest. RESULTS: We used Random Forest
               regression for integrating multiple ~ omics data for prediction
               of four quality traits of potato: tuber flesh colour, DSC onset,
               tuber shape and enzymatic discoloration. For tuber flesh colour
               beta-carotene hydroxylase and zeaxanthin epoxidase were ranked
               first and forty-fourth respectively both of which have
               previously been associated with flesh colour in potato tubers.
               Combining all the significant genes, LC-peaks, GC-peaks and
               proteins, the variation explained was 75 \%, only slightly more
               than what gene expression or LC-MS data explain by themselves
               which indicates that there are correlations among the variables
               across data sets. For tuber shape regressed on the gene
               expression, LC-MS, GC-MS and proteomics data sets separately,
               only gene expression data was found to explain significant
               variation. For DSC onset, we found 12 significant gene
               expression, 5 metabolite levels (GC) and 2 proteins that are
               associated with the trait. Using those 19 significant variables,
               the variation explained was 45 \%. Expression QTL (eQTL)
               analyses showed many associations with genomic regions in
               chromosome 2 with also the highest explained variation compared
               to other chromosomes. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis
               on enzymatic discoloration after 5 min resulted in 420
               significant genes and 8 significant LC metabolites, among which
               two were putatively identified as caffeoylquinic acid methyl
               ester and tyrosine. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we made a
               strategy for selecting and integrating multiple ~ omics data
               using random forest method and selected representative
               individual peaks for networks based on eQTL, mQTL or pQTL
               information. Network analysis was done to interpret how a

               Differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs (cut-off:
               False discovery rate (FDR)1.5) were unveiled by package edgeR of

               factors in OSCC related with overall survival (OS) and
               relapse-free survival (RFS). Protein-protein interaction (PPI)
               network was constructed for differentially expressed mRNAs using
               BioGRID, HPRD and DIP. Key hub genes were identified from top
               100 differentially expressed mRNAs ranked by betweenness
               centrality using recursive feature elimination. LncRNA-miRNA and
               miRNA-mRNA regulatory network were constructed and combined into
               ceRNAs regulatory network. Gene ontology biological terms and
               Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were identified
               using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 929
               differentially expressed mRNAs, 23 differentially expressed
               lncRNAs and 29 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified.
               59 mRNAs, 6 miRNAs (hsa-mir-133a-1, hsa-mir-1-2, hsa-mir-486,
               hsa-mir-135b, hsa-mir-196b, hsa-mir-193b) and 6 lncRNAs

               hsa-mir-196b, hsa-mir-193b) and 2 lncRNAs (PART1, TTTY14) were
               associated with RFS. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier
               containing 37 key hub genes was obtained. A ceRNA regulatory
               network containing 417 nodes and 696 edges was constructed.
               ECM-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor
               interaction, focal adhesion, arachidonic acid metabolism, and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a complex disease in which
               different genomic patterns exists depending on different
               subtypes. Recent researches present that multiple subtypes of
               breast cancer occur at different rates, and play a crucial role
               in planning treatment. To better understand underlying
               biological mechanisms on breast cancer subtypes, investigating
               the specific gene regulatory system via different subtypes is
               desirable. METHODS: Gene expression, as an intermediate
               phenotype, is estimated based on methylation profiles to
               identify the impact of epigenomic features on transcriptomic
               changes in breast cancer. We propose a kernel weighted
               l1-regularized regression model to incorporate tumor subtype
               information and further reveal gene regulations affected by
               different breast cancer subtypes. For the proper control of
               subtype-specific estimation, samples from different breast
               cancer subtype are learned at different rate based on target
               estimates. Kolmogorov Smirnov test is conducted to determine
               learning rate of each sample from different subtype. RESULTS: It
               is observed that genes that might be sensitive to breast cancer
               subtype show prediction improvement when estimated using our
               proposed method. Comparing to a standard method, overall
               performance is also enhanced by incorporating tumor subtypes. In
               addition, we identified subtype-specific network structures
               based on the associations between gene expression and DNA
               methylation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, kernel weighted lasso
               model is proposed for identifying subtype-specific associations
               between gene expressions and DNA methylation profiles.
               Identification of subtype-specific gene expression associated
               with epigenomic changes might be helpful for better planning
               treatment and developing new therapies.",

                   third-generation sequencing data cannot be used for k-mer
                   counting and estimating genomic profile based on k-mer
                   frequencies. Thus, in current genome projects,
