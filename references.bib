  abstract = "Due to the increasing throughput of current DNA sequencing
              instruments, sample multiplexing is necessary for making
              economical use of available sequencing capacities. A widely used
              multiplexing strategy for the Illumina Genome Analyzer utilizes
              sample-specific indexes, which are embedded in one of the library
              adapters. However, this and similar multiplex approaches come
              with a risk of sample misidentification. By introducing indexes
              into both library adapters (double indexing), we have developed a
              method that reveals the rate of sample misidentification within
              current multiplex sequencing experiments. With ~0.3\% these rates
              are orders of magnitude higher than expected and may severely
              confound applications in cancer genomics and other fields
              requiring accurate detection of rare variants. We identified the
              occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow as the predominant
              source of error. The accuracy of sample identification is further
              impaired if indexed oligonucleotides are cross-contaminated or if
              indexed libraries are amplified in bulk. Double-indexing
              eliminates these problems and increases both the scope and
              accuracy of multiplex sequencing on the Illumina platform.",

               communities are acquired horizontally after birth. This process
               is believed to be shaped by a combination of environmental and
               host genetic factors. We examined whether genetic variation in
               animal behavior could affect the composition of the animal's
               microbiota in different environments. The freshwater crustacean
               Daphnia magna is primarily planktonic but exhibits variation in
               the degree to which it browses in benthic sediments. We
               performed an experiment with clonal lines of D. magna showing
               different levels of sediment-browsing intensity exposed to
               either bacteria-rich or bacteria-poor sediment or whose access
               to sediments was prevented. We found that the bacterial
               composition of the environment and genotype-specific browsing
               intensity together influence the composition of the
               Daphnia-associated bacterial community. Exposure to more diverse
               bacteria did not lead to a more diverse microbiome, but greater
               abundances of environment-specific bacteria were found
               associated with host genotypes that exhibited greater browsing
               behavior. Our results indicate that, although there is a great
               deal of variation between individuals, behavior can mediate
               genotype-by-environment interaction effects on microbiome
               composition.IMPORTANCE An animal's behavior can affect its risk
               of infection, but it is not well understood how behavior affects
               microbiome composition. The aquatic crustacean Daphnia exhibits
               genetic variation in the extent to which it browses in the
               sediment at the bottoms of ponds. We show that this behavior
               affects the Daphnia microbiome, indicating that genetic
               variation among individuals may affect microbiome composition

               during the DNA extraction process may result in inaccurate
               microbial representation. In this study, we attempted to find a
               DNA extraction protocol which could be effectively used to
               analyze both the bacterial and fungal community. We evaluated
               the effect of five DNA extraction methods (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini
               Kit, PureLinkTM Microbiome DNA Purification Kit, ZR Fecal DNA
               MiniPrepTM Kit, NucleoSpin\textregistered{} DNA Stool Kit, and
               IHMS protocol Q) on bacterial and fungal gut microbiome recovery
               using (i) a defined system of germ-free mice feces spiked with
               bacterial or fungal strains, and (ii) non-spiked human feces. In
               our experimental setup, we confirmed that the examined methods
               significantly differed in efficiency and quality, which affected
               the identified stool microbiome composition. In addition, our
               results indicated that fungal DNA extraction might be prone to
               be affected by reagent/kit contamination, and thus an
               appropriate blank control should be included in mycobiome
               research. Overall, standardized IHMS protocol Q, recommended by
               the International Human Microbiome Consortium, performed the
               best when considering all the parameters analyzed, and thus
               could be applied not only in bacterial, but also in fungal
               microbiome research.",

               achieve sufficient coverage of informative nonribosomal
               transcripts. In eukaryotic samples, this is typically achieved
               by selective oligo(dT)-priming of messenger RNAs to exclude
               ribosomal RNA (rRNA) during cDNA synthesis. However, this
               strategy is not compatible with prokaryotes in which functional
               transcripts are generally not polyadenylated. To overcome this,
               we adopted DASH (depletion of abundant sequences by
               hybridization), initially developed for eukaryotic cells, to
               improve both the sensitivity and depth of bacterial RNA-seq.
               DASH uses the Cas9 nuclease to remove unwanted cDNA sequences
               prior to library amplification. We report the design,
               evaluation, and optimization of DASH experiments for standard
               bacterial short-read sequencing approaches, including software
               for automated guide RNA (gRNA) design for Cas9-mediated cleavage

               effectively removed rRNA reads (56\%-86\%) in RNA-seq libraries

               sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial
               populations that may have important roles in their environments.
               Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates
               metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and
               pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and
               sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists
               to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction
               algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools
               for their evaluation and visualization. To address these
               challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for
               shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys
               state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing
               starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic
               bins and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give
               investigators control over the analysis, while still being
               easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms
               that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract
               and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin
               consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAP's hybrid bin extraction
               algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other
               bin consolidation programs in both synthetic and real data sets.
               Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis
               of metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance
               estimation, functional annotation, and visualization. MetaWRAP
               is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that automates the core tasks
               in metagenomic analysis, while contributing significant
               improvements to the extraction and interpretation of
               high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin refinement and reassembly
               modules of metaWRAP consistently outperform other binning
               approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is also a standalone
               component, making it a flexible and versatile tool for tackling

               derives mostly from studies in which elucidation of

               Drosophila melanogaster acquires its microbiome, we found that a
               microbial community influences Drosophila olfactory and
               egg-laying behaviors differently than individual members.
               Drosophila prefers a Saccharomyces-Acetobacter co-culture to the
               same microorganisms grown individually and then mixed, a
               response mainly due to the conserved olfactory receptor, Or42b.
               Acetobacter metabolism of Saccharomyces-derived ethanol was
               necessary, and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were
               sufficient, for co-culture preference. Preference correlated
               with three emergent co-culture properties: ethanol catabolism, a
               distinct volatile profile, and yeast population decline.
               Egg-laying preference provided a context-dependent fitness
               benefit to larvae. We describe a molecular mechanism by which a
               microbial community affects animal behavior. Our results support

               importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of
               gene expression at the moment of RNA extraction. Until recently,
               there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity
               of RNA samples and the ratio of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA, the
               common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be
               inconsistent. The advent of microcapillary electrophoretic RNA
               separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput
               approach, in order to estimate the integrity of RNA samples in
               an unambiguous way. METHODS: A method is introduced that
               automatically selects features from signal measurements and
               constructs regression models based on a Bayesian learning
               technique. Feature spaces of different dimensionality are
               compared in the Bayesian framework, which allows selecting a
               final feature combination corresponding to models with high
               posterior probability. RESULTS: This approach is applied to a
               large collection of electrophoretic RNA measurements recorded
               with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that
               describes RNA integrity. The resulting algorithm is a
               user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for
               standardization of RNA quality control that allows the
               calculation of an RNA integrity number (RIN). CONCLUSION: Our
               results show the importance of taking characteristics of several
               regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order
               to get a robust and reliable prediction of RNA integrity,

               RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses at reasonable sequencing
               depth, typically, mature polyadenylated transcripts are enriched
               or rRNA molecules are depleted. Targeted depletion of rRNA is
               particularly useful when studying transcripts lacking a poly(A)
               tail, such as some non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), most bacterial RNAs
               and partially degraded or immature transcripts. While several
               commercially available kits allow effective rRNA depletion,
               their efficiency relies on a high degree of sequence homology
               between oligonucleotide probes and the target RNA. This
               restricts the use of such kits to a limited number of organisms

               most non-model organisms lacking complete reference genomes with
               high-quality annotation of genetic information, reference-free
               (RF) de novo transcriptome analyses, rather than reference-based
               (RB) approaches, are widely used, and RF analyses have
               substantially contributed toward understanding the mechanisms
               regulating key biological processes and functions. To date,
               numerous bioinformatics studies have been conducted for
               assessing the workflow, production rate, and completeness of
               transcriptome assemblies within and between RF and RB datasets.
               However, the degree of consistency and variability of results
               obtained by analyzing gene expression levels through these two
               different approaches have not been adequately documented.
               RESULTS: In the present study, we evaluated the differences in
               expression profiles obtained with RF and RB approaches and
               revealed that the former tends to be satisfactorily replaced by
               the latter with respect to transcriptome repertoires, as well as
               from a gene expression quantification perspective. In addition,

               to large gene families must be validated carefully, whenever

              gnavus species which showed maximum abundance in a 9 min beaten
              sample. However, the remaining 50\% of reads could not be

               how to handle highly similar MAGs assembled from independent

               different software packages and parameters used to resolve this

               requiring substantial amounts of memory (∼320 GB) which limits
               its adoption and ease of use. Here, we present an update to

               are still limited in quantity and effectiveness, and making
               treatment decisions for individual patients remains a hard
               problem. Established subtypes, which help guide these decisions,
               are mainly based on individual data types. However, the analysis
               of multidimensional patient data involving the measurements of
               various molecular features could reveal intrinsic
               characteristics of the tumor. Large-scale projects accumulate
               this kind of data for various cancer types, but we still lack
               the computational methods to reliably integrate this information
               in a meaningful manner. Therefore, we apply and extend current
               multiple kernel learning for dimensionality reduction
               approaches. On the one hand, we add a regularization term to
               avoid overfitting during the optimization procedure, and on the
               other hand, we show that one can even use several kernels per
               data type and thereby alleviate the user from having to choose
               the best kernel functions and kernel parameters for each data

               Moreover, our resulting subtypes reflect combined patterns from

               in which some patients have data for only a subset of the omics,
               without performing data imputation. In extensive testing on ten

               comparable to the best of nine state-of-the-art multi-omics

               has highlighted a particular challenge: to integrate the
               different views of the genome that are provided by various types
               of experimental data. RESULTS: This paper describes a
               computational framework for integrating and drawing inferences
               from a collection of genome-wide measurements. Each dataset is
               represented via a kernel function, which defines generalized
               similarity relationships between pairs of entities, such as
               genes or proteins. The kernel representation is both flexible
               and efficient, and can be applied to many different types of
               data. Furthermore, kernel functions derived from different types
               of data can be combined in a straightforward fashion. Recent
               advances in the theory of kernel methods have provided efficient
               algorithms to perform such combinations in a way that minimizes
               a statistical loss function. These methods exploit semidefinite
               programming techniques to reduce the problem of finding
               optimizing kernel combinations to a convex optimization problem.

               strategies to boost prediction performance based on the use of

               via the use of multiple kernel learning supervised learning
               methods. We propose a scheme in which feature selection by
               statistical score is performed separately per data type and by
               pathway membership. We further consider the introduction of a
               confidence measure for the class assignment, both to remove some
               ambiguously labeled datapoints from the training data and to
               implement a cautious classifier that only makes predictions when
               the associated confidence is high. RESULTS: We use the METABRIC
               dataset for breast cancer, with prediction of survival at 2000
               days from diagnosis. Predictive accuracy is improved by using
               kernels that exclusively use those genes, as features, which are
               known members of particular pathways. We show that yet further
               improvements can be made by using a range of additional kernels
               based on clinical covariates such as Estrogen Receptor (ER)
               status. Using this range of measures to improve prediction

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Cancer can involve gene dysregulation via multiple
               mechanisms, so no single level of genomic data fully elucidates
               tumor behavior due to the presence of numerous genomic
               variations within or between levels in a biological system. We
               have previously proposed a graph-based integration approach that
               combines multi-omics data including copy number alteration,
               methylation, miRNA, and gene expression data for predicting
               clinical outcome in cancer. However, genomic features likely
               interact with other genomic features in complex signaling or
               regulatory networks, since cancer is caused by alterations in
               pathways or complete processes. METHODS: Here we propose a new
               graph-based framework for integrating multi-omics data and
               genomic knowledge to improve power in predicting clinical
               outcomes and elucidate interplay between different levels. To
               highlight the validity of our proposed framework, we used an
               ovarian cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas for
               predicting stage, grade, and survival outcomes. RESULTS:
               Integrating multi-omics data with genomic knowledge to construct
               pre-defined features resulted in higher performance in clinical
               outcome prediction and higher stability. For the grade outcome,
               the model with gene expression data produced an area under the
               receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7866.

               outperformed the model with genomic data only, attaining AUCs of
               0.7873, 0.8433, 0.8254, and 0.8179, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
               Integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve
               understanding of molecular pathogenesis and underlying biology
               in cancer should improve diagnostic and prognostic indicators

               gene function with limited annotation",
  author    = "Mostafavi, Sara and Morris, Quaid",
  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: Many algorithms that integrate multiple functional
               association networks for predicting gene function construct a
               composite network as a weighted sum of the individual networks
               and then use the composite network to predict gene function. The
               weight assigned to an individual network represents the
               usefulness of that network in predicting a given gene function.
               However, because many categories of gene function have a small
               number of annotations, the process of assigning these network
               weights is prone to overfitting. RESULTS: Here, we address this
               problem by proposing a novel approach to combining multiple
               functional association networks. In particular, we present a
               method where network weights are simultaneously optimized on
               sets of related function categories. The method is simpler and
               faster than existing approaches. Further, we show that it
               produces composite networks with improved function prediction
               accuracy using five example species (yeast, mouse, fly,
               Esherichia coli and human). AVAILABILITY: Networks and code are
